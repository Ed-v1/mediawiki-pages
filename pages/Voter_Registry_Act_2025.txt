===Explanatory Statement===
This bill repeals the [[Voter Registration Act 2024|Voter Registration Act]] and [[Separating the Department of Voter Registration from the Executive Act 2025|SDVRE Act]], and enacts a new version of the act with updated language which repairs certain issues which hindered the Department of Voter Registration (“DVR”)  under the previous act. It also makes the Department of Voter Registration slightly more independent, by 
:a) Disallowing the President from automatically becoming the Secretary of Voter Registration (“SoVR”) if there is no SoVR;
:b) Requiring a two-thirds majority in the senate and a simple majority in public referendum to confirm a Secretary of Voter Registration (now known as the Registration Officer); and,
:c) Allowing both the Elections Supervisor or the President to appoint a Secretary of Voter Registration.

Among other matters, the bill resolves the following issues:
:a)Inability of the DVR to conduct inquiries into suspicious registrations;
:b)Codification of judgment disallowing use of SUITs as evidence in court (see In re Department of Voter Registration search warrant);
:c)No way for members of the public to check if they are on the registry (the Unregistered Voter and Registered Voter roles have been rather inaccurate).

===Explanatory Notes===
Section 1 of this bill relates to the establishment of the Registry Commission.

Article 1 establishes the purpose of the commission, to satisfy the requirements in Article 4 of the [[Constitution]]. It also states that the commission is led by the Registration Officer.

Article 2 manages the appointment of the Registration Officer and deputies and staff. In particular –
:a) The Registration Officer is appointed by the President or Secretary of Elections, and approved by a 2/3rds majority of the senate and a simple majority in a public referendum.
:b) The Registration Officer may be fired by appointing and confirming a different Registration Officer, subject to the same requirements.
:c) The Registration Officer may appoint a deputy, as well as staff.

Article 3 sets out the qualifications for voting, which are –
:a) Three-month old discord or reddit account;
:b) Member of core territory (member in the discord or the reddit); or,
:c) Has a valid waiver.
It also sets out the manner in which the Registration Officer may provide a waiver for (a).

Article 4 sets out the ways in which voters may be struck off the registry. These are –
:a) Providing false or misleading info to the Registry Commission
:b) Ban longer than 90 days
:c) Summary ban (CTSA, GEETSA, CPC, etc)
:d) Fails to respond to an inquiry under article 7
:e) Found guilty of electoral crimes
:f) Has not voted in 5 most recent elections
:g) Alt account

In particular, (f) is necessary due to the large number of registrations which contain no user ID and which are inactive. It is very difficult to contact such persons if they vote to ensure that their vote is legitimate, as they may have changed their usernames or left the server.

Article 5 provides the manner for the registration of voters.

§6. provides that if the Registration Officer is satisfied that someone else has used a person’s SUIT, the Registration Officer may change it, with notification to the owner.

Article 6 requires the registry to be made public from time to time. This is because the Discord roles may be outdated. Only the account information may be made public.

Article 7 provides the manner to which persons may object to the inclusion of themselves or others in the Registry (for instance, if they did not register but find their name on it anyway).

Article 8 exempts the Registry from subpoena (except for the Senate’s subpoena, which is constitutionally provided for), as well as the [[Securing Expanded Confidentiality in Reports Evidence and Transmissions Act|SECRET Act]] (to prevent the President from having access to its contents), and protects its contents from being used in court (see [[In re Department of Voter Registration Search Warrant 2025 SDSC 6|In re DVR Search Warrant]]).

Article 9 sets out that the Electoral Commission may direct the Registry Commission to perform investigations.

Article 10 repeals certain related acts, as well as a section in the [[Voter Rights Act 2023|Voter Rights Act]] which inexplicably allows the Electoral Commission to process voter registrations.
