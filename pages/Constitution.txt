== Part 9: Appendix ==

§1. The Senate shall be elected using the TEA (Threshold Equal Approval) voting method. Voters will give each candidate an integer score between 0 and 5, with 0 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. Blank scores are also permitted and will be counted as 0s.

:§1.1. Tabulation will proceed as follows.

::§1.1.1. Initialize the threshold to a score of 5. Initialize each ballot's weight to 1. Initialize the quota to the total number of ballots cast divided by the total number of available seats.

::§1.1.2. Identify all unelected candidates scored at or above the threshold on ballots with a total weight of at least a quota. If there are no such candidates, go to step §1.1.4. Otherwise, for each such candidate and the set of ballots that scored that candidate at or above the threshold, calculate the value n such that the sum of min(w, n) for all ballots in the set is equal to one quota, where w is the weight of each ballot. Elect the candidate with the least value of n, and reduce the weight of each ballot in that candidate's set by min(w, n).

::§1.1.3. If all seats are filled, tabulation is complete. Otherwise, go to step §1.1.2.

::§1.1.4. If the threshold is greater than 1, then reduce it by 1 and go to step §1.1.2.

::§1.1.5. Elect the candidate with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all ballots that give them a positive score. Set the weight of each ballot that gives them a positive score to 0.

::§1.1.6. If all seats are filled, tabulation is complete. Otherwise, go to step §1.1.5.

:§1.2. Ties at any point in the election calculations shall be broken using the following method, where candidates eliminated at each step do not move on to subsequent steps. Once only one candidate remains, any remaining steps are ignored.

::§1.2.1. Break the tie in favor of the candidate(s) with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all ballots that give them a score above the threshold.

::§1.2.2. Break the tie in favor of the candidate(s) with the greatest sum of weighted scores.

::§1.2.3. Break the tie in favor of the candidate(s) with the greatest sum of unweighted scores.

::§1.2.4. Break the tie pseudorandomly with all tied candidates given an equal probability of winning.

<ref name="countback" />§2. Vacancies in the Senate shall be filled using a proportional countback variant of the TEA (Threshold Equal Approval) voting method.

Initialization will proceed as follows, where the Senators referenced in this section are those who were members of the Senate immediately after this vacancy arose, along with any Senators who both were elected during a countback that was performed prior to the initiation of this countback and did not leave the Senate prior to the opening of this vacancy.
::§2.1.1. Initialize the virtual threshold to a score of 5. Initialize each ballot’s weight to 1. Initialize the quota to match the quota used in the most recent Senate election.
::§2.1.2. Determine which Senators are scored at or above the virtual threshold on ballots with a total weight of at least a quota. If there are no such Senators, go to step §2.1.4. Otherwise, for each such Senator and the set of ballots that scored that Senator at or above the virtual threshold, calculate the value n such that the sum of min(w, n) for all ballots in the set is equal to one quota, where w is the weight of each ballot. Identify the Senator with the least value of n, and reduce the weight of each ballot in that Senator’s set by min(w, n).
::§2.1.3. If any Senators have not yet been identified, go to step §2.1.2. Otherwise, go to step §2.1.7.
::§2.1.4. If the virtual threshold is greater than 1, then reduce it by 1 and go to step §2.1.2.
::§2.1.5. Identify the Senator with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all ballots that give them a positive score. Set the weight of each ballot that gives them a positive score to 0.
::§2.1.6. If any Senators have not yet been identified, go to step §2.1.5.
::§2.1.7. Initialize the threshold to a score of 5.
:§2.2. After initialization, tabulation will proceed as follows.
::§2.2.1. Determine which eligible candidates are scored at or above the threshold on ballots with a total weight of at least a quota. If there are no such candidates, go to step §2.2.2. Otherwise, for each such candidate and the set of ballots that scored that candidate at or above the threshold, calculate the value n such that the sum of min(w, n) for all ballots in the set is equal to one quota, where w is the weight of each ballot. Elect the candidate with the least value of n. Tabulation is complete.
::§2.2.2. If the threshold is greater than 1, then reduce it by 1 and go to step §2.2.1.
:§2.2.3. Elect the eligible candidate with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all ballots that give them a positive score. Tabulation is complete.

:§2.1. Initialization will proceed as follows, where the Senators referenced in this section are those who were members of the Senate immediately after this vacancy arose, along with any Senators who both were elected during a by-election that was initiated prior to the initiation of this by-election and did not leave the Senate prior to the opening of this vacancy.<ref name="BEHA">Amended by the [[By-Elections Hotfix Amendment]]</ref>
::§2.1.1. For each voter, construct a virtual ballot that assigns each Senator the same rating the voter gave them in the election or by-election in which that Senator was elected. If a voter did not vote in all such elections, then no virtual ballot is constructed for them.
::§2.1.2. Initialize the virtual threshold to a score of 5. Initialize each virtual ballot’s weight to 1. Initialize the quota to match the quota used in the most recent Senate election.
::§2.1.3. Identify all Senators scored at or above the virtual threshold on virtual ballots with a total weight of at least a quota. If there are no such candidates, go to step §2.1.5. Otherwise, for each such Senator and the set of virtual ballots that scored that Senator at or above the virtual threshold, calculate the value n such that the sum of min(w, n) for all virtual ballots in the set is equal to one quota, where w is the weight of each virtual ballot. Identify the Senator with the least value of n, and reduce the weight of each virtual ballot in that Senator’s set by min(w, n).
::§2.1.4. If any Senators have not yet been identified, go to step §2.1.3. Otherwise, go to step §2.1.8.
::§2.1.5. If the virtual threshold is greater than 1, then reduce it by 1 and go to step §2.1.3.
::§2.1.6. Identify the Senator with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all virtual ballots that give them a positive score. Set the weight of each virtual ballot that gives them a positive score to 0.
::§2.1.7. If any Senators have not yet been identified, go to step §2.1.6.
::§2.1.8. Initialize each ballot’s weight to match the weight of the corresponding virtual ballot. If no corresponding virtual ballot exists, initialize that ballot’s weight to 0.
::§2.1.9. Initialize the threshold to a score of 5.
:§2.2. After initialization, tabulation will proceed as follows.
::§2.2.1. Identify all candidates scored at or above the threshold on ballots with a total weight of at least a quota. If there are no such candidates, go to step §2.2.2. Otherwise, for each such candidate and the set of ballots that scored that candidate at or above the threshold, calculate the value n such that the sum of min(w, n) for all ballots in the set is equal to one quota, where w is the weight of each ballot.

:§2.3. Ties at any point in the election calculations shall be broken using the following method, where candidates eliminated at each step do not move on to subsequent steps. Once only one candidate remains, any remaining steps are ignored. Use virtual ballots if the tie occurs during §2.1 and uses the ballots cast in this election otherwise.
::§2.3.1. Break the tie in favor of the candidate(s) with the greatest sum of ballot weights across all ballots that give them a score above the threshold.
::§2.3.2. Break the tie in favor of the candidate(s) with the greatest sum of weighted scores.

§3. The number of Senate seats to be filled shall be calculated as min(⌊3.5 + x/11⌋, 40), where x represents the voter turnout for the Senate election in question, ⌊y⌋ is the integer part of y, and min(y,z) is the minimum value between y and z. <ref name="SSA">Amended by the [[Senatorial Seats Amendment]]</ref>

§4. The President shall be elected using the STAR (Score Then Automatic Runoff) voting method where voters will give each candidate an integer score between 0 and 5, with 0 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. When a voter assigns a blank score for a presidential candidate on their ballot, that shall be equivalent to a score of 0. The candidates with the 2 highest scores enter an automatic runoff phase where the candidate who was rated a higher score between the two candidates the most number of times wins. In the event of a tie, the Official Tiebreaker Protocol recommended by the STAR voting project shall be used.

§5. Voting for elections shall always begin on a Saturday as measured by GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), with Senatorial and Presidential elections alternating weeks.

<ref name="ActPrez"></ref>§9. Where two or more persons are otherwise equal in seniority within the same category listed in §8.3–§8.6, their rank for purposes of §8 shall be determined in the following order. At each step below, apply the stated criterion to all persons still tied. Any person with a strictly superior result under that criterion ranks ahead of those with inferior results and is removed from the tied cohort for the remainder of this procedure. All persons who remain exactly tied after applying a criterion proceed together to the next step. Continue until a complete order is obtained or until §9.2.2/§9.3 requires random resolution. The order is as follows:

:§9.1. The person who received the Discord role denoting the present office earlier on the same assumption date ranks higher. 

:§9.2. If still tied, and the office is elected, rank by the greater sum of weighted scores.

::§9.2.1. If still tied, rank by the greater sum of unweighted scores.

::§9.2.2. If a tie persists among two persons, resolve by a coin flip conducted by the Discord Supervisor.

:§10.2. Upon any subsequent invocation of §8-9, including a new vacancy or incapacity, the entire procedure in §8–9 shall be rerun from the start, using the then-current records and seniority.

:§10.3. Any random resolution (coin flip or drawing of lots) shall be conducted anew for each invocation; no prior random result binds a later invocation.
