''Illustration'' 

''Blanche told Nolan that his channel fee was due in 5 months, when in fact it was due in 3 months. Relying on Blanche&#39;s statement, Nolan did not pay the fee within 3 months, and his channel was deleted. Blanche is estopped from asserting the actual 3-month deadline because Nolan relied on her representation to his detriment.''
